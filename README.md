[String Utilities](http://cancerberosgx.github.io/string-utilities)

# What is this
HTML application that contains string operations related utilities, in general, useful to developers.

# Introduction
At the beggining this project was a pet for learning some technologies new, concretely angular. But now I think it's really useful when you need to escape, quote, parse, indent, encrypt, encode, etc strings online. 

# Install and run

    npm install
    bower install
    gulp run
    firefox localhost:8080

Note: angular itself is used as js module dependency so js files are only concat (no browserify/requirejs).

Project based on angular. gulp is only used for watch, concat, sass, connect.
